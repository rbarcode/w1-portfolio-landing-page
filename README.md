# Portfolio Landing Page

#### By Richard Barbour II

#### A webpage to showcase my projects from coding bootcamp and introduce myself to the world.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS


## Description

This webpage contains a list of projects as part of the C#/REACT web development course at Epicodus. The portfolio contains a short description of each project and a link to the corresponding GitHub repository. The webpage also contains some basic biographical information about the developer.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Navigate to https://github.com/rbarcode/w1-portfolio-landing-page in an internet browser.
2. Click on the green “<> Code” button approximately 2/3s to the right-hand side of the page near the top.
3. On the “Local” tab of the mini-window that opens underneath the “<>Code” button, copy the HTTPS link in the gray bar to your clipboard.
4. In GitBash (or your terminal/shell of your choice/computer), navigate to the directory where you wish to download the project and enter the following prompt (replacing the italicized word with the appropriate link): git clone *url-of-the-repository-copied-in-the-previous-step*
5. Your chosen directory will now contain a folder titled “w1-portfolio-landing-page”.
6. You can open the folder "w1-portfolio-landing-page" in VS Code (for example, by using the appropriate commands in GitBash or using the GUI and right-clicking on the option to “Open with Code” in the menu that pops up… note, you may need to select “Show more options” at the bottom of the menu if you don’t see “Open with Code” in the provided list).
7. You can now read and edit the project files!

## Known Bugs

The main image on the page appeared offset to the right-hand side of the screen before the troubleshooting fixed the bug in a previous commit. (The bug was fixed by placing the image in a container with a "display: grid" property/value and including the property/value "place-items: center".)
