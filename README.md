_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

The main image on the page appeared offset to the right-hand side of the screen before the troubleshooting fixed the bug in a previous commit. (The bug was fixed by placing the image in a container with a "display: grid" property/value and including the property/value "place-items: center".)
